# Faux-Finder_-Real-VS-Fake-Art-Detection
This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to distinguish between real and fake artwork. Faux-Finder is designed to analyze art authenticity by learning the intricate patterns, textures, and styles of genuine artworks and detecting anomalies in counterfeit pieces.
